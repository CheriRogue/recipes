    <h2>How to Make the Best Chocolate Covered Strawberries</h2>

    <p>Why pay top dollar for chocolate-covered strawberries when you can easily make them at home -- super fresh and at
        a fraction of the cost? Our chocolate covered strawberries are prepared using the finest ingredients. We start
        by selecting fresh, plump strawberries and then hand-dip them in real, gourmet chocolate. These perfect
        chocolate dipped strawberries come in a wide variety of flavors and fun gift bundles.</p>

    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>12 strawberries (275 grams), washed and dried</li>
        <li>4.5 oz. semi-sweet chocolate (¾ cup), melted</li>
        <li>4.5 oz. white chocolate (¾ cup), melted</li>
        <li>food colouring (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash and dry the strawberries very well. The strawberries have to be really dry or else the chocolate will
            not stick on. They have to be SUPER dry.</li>
        <li>Melt the chocolate either on the stove or in the microwave:</li>
        <ul>
            <em>On the stove</em>: Bring 2 inches of water to a low simmer in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Then turn
            the heat
            to low and place a large heatproof bowl of chocolate chips on the mouth of the pot. Make sure that there is
            a gap of a few inches in between the bottom of the bowl and the water (You can also place a bowl on a
            steamer attachment on top of your pot). Stir the chocolate constantly as it melts. Stir until the chocolate
            is completely smooth and melted. This should take a few minutes.
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <em>In the microwave</em>: The second way to melt chocolate (and an easier way) is in the microwave. Place
            the
            chocolate into a microwave safe bowl and microwave in 30 second intervals. Remove the bowl at each interval
            and stir well. Repeat until the chocolate has completely melted. Stir until completely smooth
        </ul>
        <li>Dip half the strawberries into melted semi-sweet chocolate and place on a quarter sheet baking pan lined
            with parchment paper. Dip the remaining half into melted white chocolate. (Tip: You can make the chocolate
            pink for Valentine's Day by adding a drop of red gel food colouring to the white chocolate first).</li>
        <li>Use a piping bag and round tip to drizzle the remaining chocolate on top. You can also add sprinkles or coat
            the chocolate with crushed nuts.</li>
        <li>Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes until the chocolate is set.</li>
